	<h2 id="Sedimentary">Sedimentary</h2>
		<p>Sedimentary rocks form from applied heat and pressure of layers of weathered material and sediment. They can be classified as clastic, organic, chemical, or biochemical based on their composition. These rocks typically display an array of natural processes that took place over millions of years, and aid geologists in determining the environmental characteristics in an area of interest. Some sedimentary rocks can contain millions of pieces of organic material and calcium content. While others visualize hundreds of layers of sediment that can look like waves frozen in time. Examples of sedimentary rocks are sandstone, limestone and conglomerate.</p>

	<h2 id="Igneous">Igneous</h2>
		<p>Igneous rocks have two types of classifications: intrusive and extrusive. Intrusive igneous rocks form within the deep earth near active plate boundaries where molten material crystallizes and solidifies as it slowly rises to the surface, creating gorgeous cyrstal-containing rocks. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are diorite, granite and gabbro. Extrusive igneous rocks are those as a result of violently protruding from the earth in some process such as volcanic explosion or tectonic activity. These rocks do not typically have crystalline features because they form much quicker than their counterpart. Examples of these are obsidian, pumice and andesite. </p>

	<h2 id="Metamorphic">Metamorphic</h2>
		<p>Metamorphic rocks are sedimentary, igneous, or even other metamorphic rocks that have been transformed through intensified heat and pressure. The metamorphic process typically takes place in the deep mantle where rocks that were originally on the surface or shallow earth are transported down through processes such as tectonic activity. The reformed rock contains the same or additional minerals as its previous composition, but contains even more crystallized features. An indicator of a metamorphosed rock has several layers of bands that can be manipulated to look like it has been folded over onto itself. Examples of metamorphic rocks are gneiss, schist and marble.</p>
